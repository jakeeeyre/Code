            <h2>Offering hollistic pain management solutions</h2>
            <p class="text_paragraph">I believe that you shouldn’t have to put up with or live with pain, and I am dedicated to finding out what your body is trying to tell you so that together we can work on strategies to relieve your pain. I work using a holistic approach, treating the whole body, not just the symptoms.</p>
            <p class="text_paragraph">Pain is a signal your body is telling you something is wrong or out of balance. We tend to ignore the signals and hope it will just go away! In many cases this does not happen but it’s not all bad news! Together we can create a treatment plan to address and manage a lot of your pain issues whilst opening up to looking at pain from a different perspective.</p>
            <p class="text_paragraph">If this resonates with you take a look at the different services I offer :</p>

Unlike other traditional practitioners I am passionate about developing a unique individual holistic approach, looking at all areas of your life, educating you in what your pain triggers are and reading your body’s subtle signals to help you understand what the pain is actually trying to tell you. </p>
